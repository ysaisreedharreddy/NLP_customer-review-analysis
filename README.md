Project Name: Advanced Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis

üìù Description: This repository contains my latest project on text classification and sentiment analysis using multiple machine learning models. The project aims to classify restaurant reviews into positive or negative categories, helping businesses gauge customer sentiment and improve service quality.

Technologies Used:
Python for scripting and data manipulation
NLTK for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and removing stopwords
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models and data preprocessing
XGBoost and LightGBM for boosting model performance
CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization

Project Structure:
Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning text data and preparing it for modeling
Feature Engineering: Utilizing both Bag of Words and TF-IDF techniques
Model Building: Various classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest, and ensemble methods
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to find optimal model parameters
Evaluation: Scripts for model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and more
